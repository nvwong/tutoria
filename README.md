# tutoria

Need to install bootstrap and cron (for locking and ending):<br>
pip3 install django-bootstrap4<br>
pip3 install django_cron<br>
<br><br>
Note: MyTutors model is as the admin account. <br>
username: admin <br>
password: orthosie <br><br>

Not working:<br>
1. Cannot register as both student and tutor <br>
2. Cannot create review objects automatically (cron job does it) <br>
3. MyTutors wallet won't get money because of no.2 <br>
